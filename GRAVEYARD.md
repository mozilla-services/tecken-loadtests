## Molotov support and misc testing stuff

* [Removal PR](https://github.com/mozilla-services/tecken-loadtests/pull/32)

A long time ago, we used [molotov](https://pypi.org/project/molotov/). We have
since switched to [locust](https://pypi.org/project/locust/).

Also, this repository has been used to hold Tecken system tests (now called
smoke tests) and some other things. All of that was removed.
