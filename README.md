Ability to bombard [Mozilla Symbol Server](https://github.com/mozilla-services/tecken)'s
Symbolication service with tonnes of stacks as stored in `.json` files
and the Download service with tonnes of symbol URL requests.


## To Use (for Downloads)

1. Download or clone this repo.

2. Run a Python that has
[`requests`](http://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) installed.

3. Type something like `python download.py http://localhost:8000 symbol-queries-groups.csv`
assuming you have the download server running at `localhost:8000`

4. Sit and watch it or kill it with `Ctrl-C`. If you kill it before it
finishes (finishing is likely to take hours) stats are printed out with
what's been accomplished so far.

**Alternatively** you can do the same but add another CSV file that contains
looks for `code_file` and `code_id`. For example:

```
python download.py http://localhost:8000 downloading/symbol-queries-groups.csv downloading/socorro-missing.csv
```

That second file is expected to have the following header:
```
debug_file,debug_id,code_file,code_id
```

## How To Interpret The Results (for Downloads)

The results look like this after running for a while:

```
JOBS DONE SO FAR     256
RAN FOR              146.663s
AVERAGE RATE         1.75 requests/s

STATUS CODE               COUNT          MEDIAN         AVERAGE         % RIGHT
404                         238          0.540s          0.564s           97.90
302                          18          0.541s          0.558s          100.00
```

That means that 238 URLs were sent in. In 97.9% of the cases, tecken also
found that the symbol file didn't exist (compared with what was the case
when the csv file was made).
And there were 18 requests where the symbol existed and was able to
redirect to an absolute S3 URL.


## To Use (for Symbolication)

1. Download or clone this repo.

2. Run a Python that has
[`requests`](http://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) installed.

3. Type something like `python symbolicate.py stacks http://localhost:8000`
assuming you have the symbolication server running at `localhost:8000`

4. Sit and watch it or kill it with `Ctrl-C`. If you kill it before it
finishes (finishing is likely to take hours) stats are printed out with
what's been accomplished so far.


## How To Interpret The Results (for Symbolication)

When you finish (or kill it unfinished) it will print out something
that looks like this:

```

Here's the same output but annotated with comments:

## Word Of Warning

This script picks sample JSON stacks to send in randomly. Every time.
That means that if you start it, kill it and start again, it's unlikely
that you'll be able to benefit much from the cache of the first run.


## How the `symbol-queries-groups.csv` file was made

First of all, you need to enable logging on the
`org.mozilla.crash-stats.symbols-public` and
`org.mozilla.crash-stats.symbols-private` S3 buckets. Make the logging
go to the bucket `peterbe-symbols-playground-deleteme-in-2018` and for
each make the prefix be `public-symbols/` and `private-symbols/`
respectively.

The file `symbol-queries-groups.csv` was created by running
`generate-csv-logs.py` a bunch of ways:

1. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=... python generate-csv-logs.py download`

2. `python generate-csv-logs.py summorize`

3. `python generate-csv-logs.py group`


## Molotov Testing

To start a [molotov testing](https://molotov.readthedocs.io/) there's a
`loadtest.py` script. Basic usage:

    molotov --max-runs 10 -cx loadtest.py
